== Creating an Ansible Tower Service Catalog Item

In this chapter we'll create a service catalog item to run the "Simple LAMP Stack" job template that we developed in <<running_an_ansible_tower_job_from_a_button>>.

=== Service Dialog

We need to re-import the "Simple LAMP Stack" Ansible Tower job template as a service dialog as we did previously, but this time we'll leave the "Options" box and "Limit" element in place. We use the limit element to name the VM on which we want to run the service. Once again we'll edit each element in the dialog to deselect the 'Read only" checkbox, and then finally save the new service dialog as "Simple LAMP Stack (Service)" (see <<c34bi1>>).

=== Catalog Item

We'll create a new service catalog item as we have before, but this time the catalog item type will be "AnsibleTower". We complete the catalog item definition as shown in <<c34bi2>>.

We'll select the __StateMachines/Provision/default__ state machine as our provisioning entry point.

=== Ordering the Catalog Item

Once created, we can order our new item from the service catalog. We'll see the new service dialog, which we complete with suitable values (see <<c34bi3>>).

When we click on *Submit* the job request is passed to Tower, and we can follow the progress of our job in the Tower WebUI.
